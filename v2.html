		<p class="info">Here’s a holiday insight for you: when it comes to business, relationships matter more than algorithms (but don’t tell the algorithms we said that). As we celebrate 15 years, we’re thankful for every connection that made 2024 a success. May your season be bright and your new year as clean as your best dataset. </p>
		<p class="info">Every year we send a digital holiday greeting not only for its environmental benefits, but also as a way to support charitable giving. This year, we are proud to announce that the savings from traditional postage will be donated to,  <a href="https://www.belovedasheville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beloved Ashville</a>, an organization dedicated to supporting a community hit hard by Hurricane Helene. The Freya team is saddened by the impact the Hurricane had on so many in the southern states of the US, we are honored to do what we can for one such community through this initiative.</p>
        <p class="greeting">From everyone at Freya, we wish you the best holiday season and a new year of happiness, prosperity and success. </p>
