        <p class="greeting">This season, we take time to reflect on the good things we have. Thank you to everyone that has helped support Freya Systems’ success. We hope you have a joyous holiday season. </p>
        <p class="greeting">from Ben and the rest of the <a href='https://freyasystems.com/about-us/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class='freya'>Freya Team!</a></p>
        <p class="info">Wow, this year went by quickly! Yet again we are grateful for everything the year brought us.  Freya had the privilege of working with some new clients in the water treatment and aviation space alike. This year we had some fun projects, from participating in the Philly Tech Week by hosting a Philadelphia Union themed hackathon to ones on computer vision. We were fortunate to welcome several new team members and look forward to all the challenges that 2023 will bring. </p>
        <p class="info">Every year, we design this e-card in line with our values, not only because of its ecological approach, but more importantly as an opportunity for us to donate the postage savings to a worthy local charity. This year, we chose Project-cure, given its extensive history of working to bring medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine during their time of need. If you are interested in contributing yourself, please go to <a href="https://www.projectcure.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projectcure.org</a>.</p>
