        <p class="greeting">There is no better time than the holidays to reminisce on the past year. Thank you to everyone that has helped support Freya Systems’ success. May you have a merry holiday and a prosperous New Year. </p>
        <p class="greeting">from Ben, Paul, and the whole <a href='https://freyasystems.com/about-us/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class='freya'>Freya Team!</a></p>
        <p class="info">Another year flew by and at Freya Systems we have a lot for which to be grateful. Freya Systems was named to the Philadelphia100 Fastest Growing Companies list for the second consecutive year. In addition, we were honored to be ranked on the Inc5000 list and distinguished with the Drexel LeBow Analytics50 award. We participated in Philadelphia Tech Week, showcased for the Airforce’s AFWERX in Las Vegas, and held multiple virtual events throughout the year. We were fortunate to welcome new team members, and look forward to new challenges that the next year brings. </p>
        <p class="info">Every year, we design this e-card in line with our values, not only because of its ecological approach, but more importantly as an opportunity for us to donate the postage savings to a worthy local charity. </a></p>
        <p class="info">This year, Freya Systems is donating to the Tunnels to Towers foundation, a charity dedicated to creating mortgage free homes for heroic American service men and women, first responders, their families. We find it important to help the families of fallen servicemembers and first responders after they sacrificed so much for the greater good. Feel free to donate or offer volunteering for this charity at <a href="https://www.t2t.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.t2t.org</a>.</p>
