        <p class="greeting">Best Wishes and Seasons Greetings from all your friends at Freya Systems.  It was a pleasure to work with you in 2019 and wish you a very prosperous 2020!   We'll see you all again in the New Year.</p>
        <p class="greeting">from Ben, Paul, and the entire <a href='http://www.freyasystems.com/' class='freya'>Freya Team!</a></p>
        <p class="info">At Freya, one of our goals is to do our part and try to limit our footprint in the world as much as possible.  Our goal is to always have a positive impact on the world in everything we do and any footprint we do leave is one that we hope people will follow in, to help make a positive change in the world. In keeping with our tradition, we have again designed and developed our own e-card to do our part and save some trees.  For every card we send, we will be making a donation to support the following two charities:</p>
        <p class="info">In continuing our support for our Veterans, this year we have chosen to support Tails of Valor. Tails of Valor is a nonprofit organization that was created in 2014 and they rescue and train dogs and then place them with Veterans in need. The program benefits both lives, the lives of our often-forgotten heroes who are provided with much needed physical and emotional support and that of the rescued dog.  Learn more about this amazing organization at: <a href ="http://www.tailsofvalor.org/"> www.tailsofvalor.org </a>.</p>
        <p class="info">We have also continued our support for wild animals this year by symbolically adopting a Pangolin family (yes, they are a real mammal) and an Orca family through World Wildlife Fund, an international wildlife charity working throughout the world to stop individual wild animal suffering and protect threatened species in the wild. See their compassionate conservation solutions at <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/ ">www.worldwildlife.org </a>.</p>
