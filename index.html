        <p class="greeting">Best Wishes and Seasons Greetings from all your friends at Freya Systems.  It was a pleasure to work with you in 2018 and wish you a very prosperous 2019!   We'll see you all again in the New Year.</p>
        <p class="greeting">from Ben, Paul, and the entire Freya Team!</p>
        <p class="info">At Freya, one aspect of our mission to limit our footprint in the world. As part of that Instead of a conventional paper card we design and develop our own e-card to “live” our mission and save a few trees. We want to impact the world in positive ways in everything we do. For every card we send, we are making a $5 donation to support  the following two charities.</p>
        <p class="info">In honor of the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI we have decided to support a charity helping Vetrans. We chose a local charity called Support Homeless Veterans. It is a non-profit organization created in 2011 to combat the growing epidemic of homelessness among American Veterans and is devoted to bringing quality of life to these forgotten heroes. Learn more at <a href="http://www.supporthomelessveterans.org/">www.supporthomelessveterans.org</a>.</p>
        <p class="info">We have symbolically adopted a jaguar family and an elephant family through Born Free Foundation, an international wildlife charity working throughout the world to stop individual wild animal suffering and protect threatened species in the wild. See their compassionate conservation solutions at <a href="http://www.bornfree.org.uk/">www.bornfree.org.uk</a>.</p>
