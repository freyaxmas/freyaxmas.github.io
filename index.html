        <p class="greeting">During this time, now more than ever we wish you a safe, warm and wonderful Holiday Season from your friends at Freya Systems! It was a pleasure working with you in 2020 and we wish you a prosperous 2021! We look forward to seeing you in the New Year. </p>
        <p class="greeting">from Ben, Paul, and the whole <a href='https://freyasystems.com/about-us/' class='freya'>Freya Team!</a></p>
        <p class="info">We are so proud of our team for their phenomenal efforts this year, with Freya Systems making #29 on the Philadelphia100â€™s list of fastest growing small businesses in the area. We look forward to what the future holds and working with you in 2021. </p>
        <p class="info">As we do every year, we have designed this e-card in line with our values, not only because of its environmentally friendly approach, but more importantly as an opportunity for us to donate to a worthy local charity. </a></p>
        <p class="info">This year, Freya Systems is donating to Philabundance, a local charity that is dedicated to driving hunger out of our communities and ending it forever. With 1 in 5 people in the Philadelphia area facing hunger, the effects touch all aspects of their lives. These difficult times underline how important it is to support this cause. Feel free to donate or offer volunteering for this charity at <a href="https://www.Philabundance.com/">www.philabundance.com</a>.</p>
