		<p class="info">As the year draws to a close, we extend our warmest holiday wishes for a festive season!  This year, we have deepened our commitment to fostering a culture that celebrates curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Our work in the aviation and wastewater industries has allowed us to push the boundaries and has provided us with incredible opportunities to grow as a team and as individuals. </p>
		<p class="info">As we look forward to the new year, we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. We are eager to continue this journey with you, embracing new challenges and opportunities with the same enthusiasm and commitment that have brought us this far. </p>
		<p class="info">Every year we send a digital holiday greeting not only for its environmental benefits, but also as a way to support charitable giving. This year, we are proud to announce that the savings from traditional postage will be donated to <a href="https://k9sforwarriors.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K9s for Warriors</a>, an organization dedicated to assisting veterans. The Freya team is deeply grateful for the dedication and contributions of our veterans, and we are honored to support them through this initiative. </p>
        <p class="greeting">From all of us at Freya, we wish you a joyous holiday season and a new year filled with prosperity, happiness, and success. </p>
